============= WARNING =============
This is an old X-times resurrected legacy prioject, 
so please excuse the horrible inconsitent code quality.

============= Wut about =============
Seriously I can't really tell what this creep is about anymore,
but when I started it (formally written in php), it was about organizing my
audiobooks on a homeserver and playing them via the html5 audio tag.

Now I added radio-streams, changed the language/framework to node.js and started
working on serverside mplayer playback.
I also consider to convert the whole project into a music player.

============= How to =============
Put your files into this directory structure:
pub/books/$AUTHOR/$BOOK/$CD/$TRACK.ogg

you can add covers as cover.(png/jpg/jpeg) in:
pub/books/$AUTHOR/cover.png
pub/books/$AUTHOR/$BOOK/cover.png

============= Requirements =============
Node.js 0.8.16
Tested in Chromium 20 and Firefox 17.
It will probably also work with newer versions of node.js and 
other up2date html5 browers.

Browsing books and simple mplayer list playback works, nothing else confirmed.
Html5 audiotag playback is broken atm.
